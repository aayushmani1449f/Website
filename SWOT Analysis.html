        <h3>What Is a SWOT Analysis?</h3>
        SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and so a SWOT analysis is a technique for
        assessing these four aspects of your Personality <br>
        SWOT Analysis is a tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best now, and to devise a successful
        strategy for the future. SWOT can also uncover areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your
        competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself. <br>
        A SWOT analysis examines both internal and external factors - that is, what's going on inside and outside your
        organization. So some of these factors will be within your control and some will not. In either case, the wisest
        action you can take in response will become clearer once you've discovered, recorded and analyzed as many
        factors as you can. <br>
        In this article, video and infographic, we explore how to carry out a SWOT analysis, and how to put your
        findings into action. We also include a worked example and a template to help you get started on a SWOT analysis
        in your own workplace.

    <br>
    <div class="ui">
        <h1>Four Elements Of SWOT Analysis</h1> <br> <br>
        1. <strong>Strenghts</strong> : These are factors that distinguish an organization from its competitors. These
        are special positive traits, such as a strong brand image, a loyal customer base, or a unique technology that
        provides a clear advantage to the organization compared to rivals.
        A SWOT analysis can be instrumental in identifying an organization’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP for short)
        that forms the basis for the company’s strength and keeps the business ahead of its competitors in the market.
        <br><br>
        2. <strong>Weaknesses</strong> : Like strengths, weaknesses are internal factors in a business. Identifying
        these can help identify areas of improvement. Doing this lets organizations design measures to rectify and
        control their weak points, which in turn helps the company grow.
        Like strengths, weaknesses such as low brand value, unused turnover, or lack of capital are strong attributes
        that impact and influence future course of action. <br><br>
        3.<strong>Opportunities</strong> : These are external factors that are open and available to be used by the
        organization for its benefit. Organizations must have a good eye to identify and analyze prevailing
        opportunities in the market to be able to proactively exploit them. Such tactics can provide an organization
        with an edge in the market, allowing it to realize its future growth trajectory. <br> <br>
        4. <strong>Threats</strong> : Like opportunities, these are external or outside factors that negatively impact
        business. Threats can come in many forms — financial downturns, supply chain problems, stringent government
        regulations or shifts in market requirements, etc. which are outside the control of an organization.
        Hence, it is crucial to anticipate threats in advance and take necessary precautions to avoid falling victim to
        such external events. A strong business continuity plan is key to minimizing the impact of these negative
        external factors. <br> <br>

        <h3>Pros And Cons Of SWOT Analysis</h3>
        <p> While SWOT analysis is useful for any business, large or small, there’s no such thing as a perfect
            decision-making tool. Here are a few pros and cons to consider when deciding if a SWOT analysis is right for
            your business. <br>
        </p><h4>Pros</h4>
        Free—you can use this tool with only a pen and paper or a spreadsheet, no expensive software programs needed
        <br>
        Versatile—any company or department can use this tool in just about any situation <br>
        You can use SWOT analysis to condense large amounts of information into categories by simplifying them into
        key points <br>
        Simple and fast to learn<br>
        Can be an easy way to identify strengths and weakness and also new opportunities<br>
        Helps set objectives when planning and setting goals <br>

        <h4>Cons</h4>
        Might be too simplistic for complex problems or situationsbr
        <br>
        Doesn’t prioritize which issues are the most important or urgentbr
        <br>
        May generate more ideas than you need br
        <br>

        <br>

        <br>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Who should do a SWOT Analysis? </h3>
        <p>For a SWOT analysis to be effective, company founders and leaders need to be deeply involved. This isn’t a
            task
            that can be delegated to others.
            But, company leadership shouldn’t do the work on their own, either. For best results, you’ll want to gather
            a
            group of people who have different perspectives on the company. Select people who can represent different
            aspects of your company, from sales and customer service to marketing and product development. Everyone
            should
            have a seat at the table.
            Innovative companies even look outside their own internal ranks when they perform a SWOT analysis and get
            input
            from customers to add their unique voice to the mix.
            If you’re starting or running a business on your own, you can still do a SWOT analysis. Recruit additional
            points of view from friends who know a little about your business, your accountant, or even vendors and
            suppliers. The key is to have different points of view.
            Existing businesses can use a SWOT analysis to assess their current situation and determine a strategy to
            move
            forward. But, remember that things are constantly changing and you’ll want to reassess your strategy,
            starting
            with a new SWOT analysis every six to 12 months.
            For startups, a SWOT analysis is part of the business planning process. It’ll help codify a strategy so that
            you
            start off on the right foot and know the direction that you plan to go.</p>
